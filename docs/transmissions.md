## ENEMY BRIEFINGS

### Drifters

-   "Viper-1, Drifters incoming. Mindless husks. They just... float toward you. Like moths to a very explosive flame. You're the flame."
-   "HQ here. Drifters on scope. No weapons, no tactics, just an overwhelming desire to hug your hull. Don't let them."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Drifters detected. They're fast, dumb, and die easy. My favorite combination."
-   "Drifters approaching. Intel says they used to be cargo drones. Now they're just... angry cargo. With teeth."
-   "Viper-1, you've got Drifters. They burst when elite. Like popcorn. Deadly, hull-shredding popcorn."

### Watchers

-   "Watchers on radar, Viper-1. They shoot back. Revolutionary concept out here, apparently."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Watchers inbound. They like to keep their distance and plink at you. Rude, honestly."
-   "Command here. Watchers detected. Those eye-looking things? Yeah, they see you. And they're judging."
-   "Viper-1, Watchers approaching. Elite variants go full rapid-fire. Like they've got something to prove."
-   "Watchers on scope. Slow movers, decent shots. Take them out before they get comfortable."

### Mass

-   "Viper-1, Mass signatures detected. Big, slow, tanky. The space equivalent of a brick wall that shoots back."
-   "HQ here. Mass units incoming. They take a beating and keep coming. Respect the hustle, fear the bulk."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Mass detected. When the elite ones die, they burst. It's their final 'screw you.'"
-   "Mass approaching. Thick armor, slow brain. Aim for the glowy bits. There's always glowy bits."
-   "Viper-1, Mass on radar. They're basically flying tanks. With guns. And bad attitudes."

### Phantoms

-   "Phantoms detected, Viper-1. They phase in and out. Very annoying. Very dead if you time it right."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Phantoms incoming. Now you see them, now you don't, now they're ramming your cockpit."
-   "Command here. Phantoms on scope. They flicker like bad holograms. Shoot the solid parts."
-   "Viper-1, Phantoms approaching. They think being semi-transparent makes them special. Prove them wrong."

### Orbiters

-   "Orbiters incoming, Viper-1. They circle and shoot. Like vultures with plasma cannons."
-   "HQ here. Orbiters detected. Fast, evasive, and they never fly straight. Show-offs."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Orbiters on radar. They'll try to flank you. Don't let them get comfortable."
-   "Viper-1, Orbiters approaching. Elite variants go rapid-fire. Because regular fire wasn't annoying enough."
-   "Orbiters detected. They orbit. Hence the name. Command is very creative with designations."

### Splitters

-   "Splitters on scope, Viper-1. Kill one, get two free. Worst deal in the sector."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Splitters incoming. They reproduce by dying. Evolution really dropped the ball here."
-   "Command here. Splitters detected. Pop one and it becomes a family reunion. A hostile family reunion."
-   "Viper-1, Splitters approaching. Elite ones explode on death. Because splitting wasn't enough drama."
-   "Splitters detected. They're like cockroaches. Kill one, two more show up. Except in space. And bigger."

## LORE DROPS
