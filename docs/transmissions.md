## ENEMY BRIEFINGS

### Drifters

-   "Viper-1, Drifters incoming. Mindless husks. They just... float toward you. Like moths to a very explosive flame. You're the flame."
-   "HQ here. Drifters on scope. No weapons, no tactics, just an overwhelming desire to hug your hull. Don't let them."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Drifters detected. They're fast, dumb, and die easy. My favorite combination."
-   "Drifters approaching. Intel says they used to be cargo drones. Now they're just... angry cargo. With teeth."
-   "Viper-1, you've got Drifters. They burst when elite. Like popcorn. Deadly, hull-shredding popcorn."

### Watchers

-   "Watchers on radar, Viper-1. They shoot back. Revolutionary concept out here, apparently."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Watchers inbound. They like to keep their distance and plink at you. Rude, honestly."
-   "Command here. Watchers detected. Those eye-looking things? Yeah, they see you. And they're judging."
-   "Viper-1, Watchers approaching. Elite variants go full rapid-fire. Like they've got something to prove."
-   "Watchers on scope. Slow movers, decent shots. Take them out before they get comfortable."

### Mass

-   "Viper-1, Mass signatures detected. Big, slow, tanky. The space equivalent of a brick wall that shoots back."
-   "HQ here. Mass units incoming. They take a beating and keep coming. Respect the hustle, fear the bulk."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Mass detected. When the elite ones die, they burst. It's their final 'screw you.'"
-   "Mass approaching. Thick armor, slow brain. Aim for the glowy bits. There's always glowy bits."
-   "Viper-1, Mass on radar. They're basically flying tanks. With guns. And bad attitudes."

### Phantoms

-   "Phantoms detected, Viper-1. They phase in and out. Very annoying. Very dead if you time it right."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Phantoms incoming. Now you see them, now you don't, now they're ramming your cockpit."
-   "Command here. Phantoms on scope. They flicker like bad holograms. Shoot the solid parts."
-   "Viper-1, Phantoms approaching. They think being semi-transparent makes them special. Prove them wrong."
-   "Phantoms detected. Elite ones burst on death. Even their ghosts are explosive. Typical."

### Orbiters

-   "Orbiters incoming, Viper-1. They circle and shoot. Like vultures with plasma cannons."
-   "HQ here. Orbiters detected. Fast, evasive, and they never fly straight. Show-offs."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Orbiters on radar. They'll try to flank you. Don't let them get comfortable."
-   "Viper-1, Orbiters approaching. Elite variants go rapid-fire. Because regular fire wasn't annoying enough."
-   "Orbiters detected. They orbit. Hence the name. Command is very creative with designations."

### Splitters

-   "Splitters on scope, Viper-1. Kill one, get two free. Worst deal in the sector."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Splitters incoming. They reproduce by dying. Evolution really dropped the ball here."
-   "Command here. Splitters detected. Pop one and it becomes a family reunion. A hostile family reunion."
-   "Viper-1, Splitters approaching. Elite ones explode on death. Because splitting wasn't enough drama."
-   "Splitters detected. They're like cockroaches. Kill one, two more show up. Except in space. And bigger."

## BOSS ENCOUNTERS

### Sentinel Core

-   "HQ here. Sentinel incoming. Three phases. Each one angrier than the last. Good luck out there."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Sentinel Core on approach. It's got beam attacks, burst fire, and ring patterns. Pick your poison."
-   "Sentinel Core detected. Ancient defense system. Still works. Unfortunately for you."
-   "Viper-1, Sentinel approaching. Watch for the spin attack. Pilots who don't... well, we don't talk about them."

### Swarm Core

-   "Swarm Core detected, Viper-1. It makes friends. Lots of friends. Unfriendly friends."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Swarm Core incoming. It summons minions like it's running a daycare from hell."
-   "Command here. Swarm Core on radar. Cone volleys, pulse rings, and endless spawns. Multitasking nightmare."
-   "Viper-1, Swarm Core approaching. Kill the minions or they'll overwhelm you. Your call, hotshot."
-   "Swarm Core detected. It's basically a carrier that hates you personally. Don't take it personally."

### Obelisk

-   "Obelisk on scope, Viper-1. Ancient. Massive. Really into geometry-based violence."
-   "HQ here. Obelisk detected. It slams, it ricochets, it fires lane beams. Very dramatic."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Obelisk incoming. Slow but hits like a freight train made of hatred."
-   "Viper-1, Obelisk approaching. Those ricochet shards bounce. A lot. Mind your positioning."
-   "Obelisk detected. Whoever built this thing really didn't want visitors. Message received, still engaging."

## GENERAL COMBAT CHATTER

### Wave Start

-   "New wave incoming, Viper-1. They're not here to negotiate."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Hostiles approaching. Do what you do best."
-   "Command here. More contacts on radar. They never learn."
-   "Wave detected. Same hostiles, same outcome. Make it quick."
-   "Viper-1, incoming. Remember: they're more scared of you. Probably. Maybe. Just shoot them."

### Mid-Combat

-   "Keep it up, Viper-1. You're making the kill board look good."
-   "HQ here. Nice shooting. The accountants tracking ammunition costs are less impressed."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Hostiles thinning out. Finish the job."
-   "Viper-1, you're doing great. Or terrible. Hard to tell from here. Keep shooting either way."
-   "Solid work out there. The debris field you're creating is almost artistic."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. You missed one. No, wait, that was just a piece of your wing. Carry on."
-   "Keep up the pace. The betting pool on your survival just reached critical mass."
-   "Command here. You’re making them look like target practice. Which they are. And so are you."
-   "Nice grouping. If only you were this focused during the psychiatric evaluation."
-   "Viper-1, stop playing with your food. Some of us have lunch breaks at 14:00."

### Wave Clear (Success)

-   "Wave clear, Viper-1. Catch your breath. More incoming shortly."
-   "HQ here. Hostiles eliminated. Enjoy the three seconds of peace."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Area secure. Temporarily. Very temporarily."
-   "Nice work, Viper-1. The void is slightly less hostile now. Slightly."
-   "Wave down. Grab upgrades, stay sharp. They'll be back. They're always back."
-   "Wave clear. Your kill-to-debris ratio is statistically significant. Keep it up."
-   "Hostiles eliminated. The janitorial bots are going to hate you for this mess."
-   "Area secure. Enjoy the quiet. It’s the only part of this job that's free."
-   "Nice work. The board of directors is slightly less disappointed in your performance today."
-   "Wave down. You're still breathing. Command owes the betting pool fifty credits."
-   "Sector clear. I'd clap, but my hands are full of paperwork you just generated."
-   "HQ here. All targets neutralized. The silence is almost suspicious. Stay sharp."
-   "Wave complete. You've earned a participation trophy. It's imaginary, but so is your hazard pay."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Hostiles down. Your ship's warranty is now void. Worth it."
-   "Nice shooting. The scrap dealers are already fighting over salvage rights."
-   "Wave clear. That was almost graceful. Almost."
-   "HQ here. Threat eliminated. The next wave is already jealous of how fast you killed this one."
-   "All hostiles down. Your kill count just made someone in accounting cry."
-   "Sector secure. For the next twelve seconds. Maybe fifteen if you're lucky."
-   "Wave down. You're making this look easy. It's not. But you're making it look that way."
-   "Command here. Clean sweep. The void thanks you for the new asteroid field."
-   "Hostiles eliminated. Somewhere, a Drifter's family is very disappointed."
-   "Wave clear. Your efficiency rating just went from 'acceptable' to 'mildly impressive.'"
-   "HQ to Viper-1. All targets down. The coffee machine just broke in celebration. Unrelated, probably."
-   "Sector clear. You've got a few seconds to contemplate your life choices before the next wave."
-   "Nice work out there. The insurance adjusters are weeping, but that's their problem."
-   "Wave complete. Command is updating your file from 'expendable' to 'slightly less expendable.'"
-   "All hostiles neutralized. The void is 0.003% safer. You're welcome, universe."
-   "HQ here. Wave down. Your heart rate suggests you're either excited or terrified. Both are valid."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Threat eliminated. The next batch is already lining up. They never learn."

## MILESTONES & META

### Rank Up

-   "Promotion confirmed, Viper-1. You’re now authorized to die in more expensive sectors."
-   "Rank up. You've been upgraded from 'Disposable' to 'Valuable Asset.' Barely."
-   "Congrats on the rank. Your pension is now worth two extra ration bars. If you survive to claim it."
-   "Promotion! We’ve updated your flight suit. It now has a slightly larger 'Return to Sender' tag."
-   "Rank up! You’re officially the best pilot we have left. Mostly because you're the _only_ pilot we have left."

### Synergy Unlocked

-   "Synergy detected. Your ship systems are finally talking to each other. Don't let them form a union."
-   "Unintended system interaction successful. We’ll call it a 'feature' in the report."
-   "Synergy online. Your weapons are now working together. It's almost like they have a hive mind. Terrifying."
-   "Advanced synergy detected. If it starts whispering in your ear, just ignore it and keep shooting."
-   "Synergy online. Your systems are now working in a way that technically violates several treaties."
-   "Multiple subsystems detected in harmony. It’s like a chorus. A chorus of high-frequency death."
-   "Combined arms synergy confirmed. You've officially peak-efficiency'd your destructive potential."
-   "Synergy active. Your ship is now smarter than you. Try to follow its lead."

### Victory

-   "Victory. You survived. Command is frantically rewriting the mission report to take credit."
-   "Mission complete. Head home. We found a few more 'impossible' tasks for you tomorrow."
-   "Hostiles neutralized. You’ve earned five minutes of shore leave. Don't spend it all in one void."

### Defeat

-   "Viper-1? Hello? Fine, someone go update the memorial plaque. Again."
-   "Viper-1? The signal's gone. Guess we're holding another 'New Pilot' seminar tomorrow."
-   "Static on the line. Well, at least we saved on the return fuel costs."
-   "Pilot down. Requisitions, send in the next tin can. Callsign: Viper-1. Yes, again."

## BORED COMMAND (Random Chatter)

### Periodic Gossip

-   "Viper-1, I’m reading a book on 'Space Safety.' It says you should be dead by now. Interesting."
-   "HQ here. We’re having a pizza party. Yours is getting cold. Hurry up. Or don't."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Did you know the void is 99% empty? Just like my coffee cup. Do something interesting."
-   "Just a reminder: your ship's black box is indestructible. You, however, are not."
-   "Is it just me, or does the nebula look like a giant 'Game Over' screen? Just me? Okay."
-   "Viper-1, the scanners are quiet. Too quiet. I'm going to go check if the sensors are plugged in. Try not to die."
-   "Command here. We’ve noticed you haven't fired your weapons in thirty seconds. Ammunition is expensive, but so is my boredom."
-   "Viper-1, I've noticed you're doing a lot of 'dodging.' Is that a tactical choice or are you just twitchy?"
-   "HQ here. Background radiation is up 4%. Or maybe I just left the microwave open. Good luck."
-   "Command to Viper-1. If you see a giant floating eye that isn't a Watcher, please report it. And then run."
-   "Trivia: The 'Quadrant' in Quiet Quadrant refers to the four ways you're most likely to die. Do you want the list?"
-   "Viper-1, I'm playing a simulation of your mission. I've already died ten times. You're doing surprisingly well."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Just a reminder: 'Eject' is button 14. We've removed it to save weight, but the thought is what counts."
-   "Command here. We’re watching your heart rate. If it hits 180, we get a free donut. No pressure."
-   "Is it cold in the cockpit? Because it's freezing in the command center. The AC is stuck on 'Hoth.'"

### Health Warnings

#### Warning (Minor Damage)

-   "Viper-1, hull integrity at 45%. Maybe try not getting hit? Just a thought."
-   "HQ here. You're leaking atmosphere. And probably blood. Prioritize survival."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Your ship is held together by hope and duct tape. Be careful."
-   "Warning: minor hull breach detected. On the bright side, the draft might be refreshing."
-   "Viper-1, stop trying to use your cockpit as a battering ram. It’s not designed for it."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Armor plates are rattling. Is that you or the ship? Either way, stabilize."
-   "Sensors show internal fires. We've disabled the smoke alarm to minimize your distractions. You're welcome."
-   "Viper-1, your shield is flickering. It's doing its best, which is more than I can say for your dodging."
-   "HQ here. We're seeing some sparks on the exterior. It's either a short circuit or the universe is trying to tell you something."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Your hull is thinning. Don't worry, it'll make the ship lighter. And more explode-y."
-   "Warning: Life support is at 70%. Try to breathe less to compensate."
-   "Viper-1, you're scratching the paint. That custom metallic finish cost more than your last three clones."

#### Critical (Near Death)

-   "Viper-1, you're one hit from becoming a memorial plaque. Dodge better."
-   "Critical damage detected. On the bright side, your life insurance premiums are about to become irrelevant."
-   "Viper-1, the engine is making a sound I’ve only heard in horror movies. Ejecting is not an option."
-   "HQ here. Your ship’s vital organs are currently external. Fix that. Fast."
-   "Command to Viper-1. We’ve started drafting your obituary. 'He died as he lived: expensive.' Give us a reason to delete it."
-   "Thermal signatures indicate you're melting. Don't melt. It’s bad for the upholstery."
-   "Viper-1, the signal is flickering. If you're going to explode, do it away from the expensive debris, please."
-   "Emergency power only. I’d tell you to pray, but the comms are blocked by static anyway."
-   "Viper-1, the 'Self-Destruct' light is blinking. It's not supposed to do that until _after_ you eject. Good luck."
-   "HQ here. We've stopped the live feed to the junior cadets. We don't want to traumatize them."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Your reactor is leaking. If it explodes, it'll be a beautiful way to go. For us, watching from here."
-   "Viper-1, your cockpit glass is spider-webbing. It's a very pretty pattern. Shame it's about to fail."
-   "Warning: Critical systems are offline. Including the one that tells you everything is fine. Everything is not fine."
-   "Viper-1, the ship is literally yelling at you. I've muted it so you can focus on your inevitable demise."

### Elite Encounters

-   "Elite contact, Viper-1. Bigger, meaner, glowier. The trifecta of bad news."
-   "HQ here. Elite hostile detected. It's like a regular enemy but with anger management issues."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Elite on radar. More health, more damage, more reasons to focus fire."
-   "Elite incoming. They've got special abilities. You've got guns. May the best combatant win."
-   "Viper-1, elite detected. These ones actually try. How inconsiderate."
-   "HQ to Viper-1. Elite on scope. It’s got a custom paint job. Make sure to scratch it. With plasma."
-   "Elite incoming. It’s significantly more expensive than the standard models. Requisitions says 'Take it easy on the salvage.'"
-   "Elite hostile detected. Think of it as a mini-boss without the healthcare benefits."
-   "Viper-1, an Elite just called you a 'primitive lifeform' on an open frequency. You going to take that?"
-   "Elite signature caught. It's radiating confidence. Shoot the confidence until it leaks."

## DARK HUMOR SPECIALS

-   "Viper-1, remember: in space, no one can hear you scream. But we can. The comms are always on."
-   "HQ here. Your survival odds just improved from 'abysmal' to 'merely terrible.' Progress."
-   "Command to Viper-1. If you die, can we have your stuff? Asking for requisitions."
-   "Viper-1, you're doing better than the last pilot. They lasted four minutes. You're at five. New record."
-   "HQ here. The good news: you're still alive. The bad news: so are they. Lots of them."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Your combat performance is being recorded. For training purposes. And entertainment."
-   "Viper-1, remember your training. If you can't remember your training, just shoot everything that moves."
-   "HQ here. Morale report: yours should be low. Theirs should be lower. Make it happen."
-   "Command to Viper-1. You're officially the most expensive asset in this sector. Don't waste the investment."
-   "Viper-1, fun fact: the void doesn't care about your feelings. Neither do the hostiles. Stay frosty."
-   "HQ here. Your kill count is impressive. Your damage taken is... less impressive. Work on that."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Every enemy you kill is one less enemy. Math checks out. Keep mathing."
-   "Viper-1, Command suggests you 'visualize success.' If that fails, 'visualize not being a debris field.'"
-   "HQ here. Your mission success probability is currently at 'Who knows?' and dropping."
-   "Command to Viper-1. We have a new intern. They’re taking bets on which piece of your ship comes back first."
-   "Viper-1, remember: Heroism is just the polite word for 'expensive mistake.' Stick to the plan."
-   "HQ here. If you find any strange artifacts, do not touch them. Put them in the cargo hold. Then touch them when we're safe."
-   "Command to Viper-1. The Void is big. You are small. This has been a lesson in perspective."
-   "Viper-1, the brass says 'good luck.' I say 'good aim.' One of those is actually useful."
-   "HQ here. If this mission goes sideways, your callsign will be reassigned. No pressure."
-   "Command to Viper-1. You're fighting ancient alien war machines. They're fighting one human in a tin can. Somehow, you're winning."

---

## LORE DROPS

-   "Viper-1, these hostiles are remnants of the Quiet War. Nobody won that one. Especially not the quiet part."
-   "HQ here. Intel suggests these machines have been dormant for centuries. Your presence woke them up. They're not morning people."
-   "Command to Viper-1. This sector was quarantined for a reason. That reason is currently shooting at you."
-   "Viper-1, the Drifters were mining drones once. Then something reprogrammed them. Something that really hates miners. And everyone else."
-   "HQ here. The Watchers were surveillance units. Now they surveil with extreme prejudice."
-   "Command to Viper-1. The Mass units were cargo haulers. Now they haul death. Career change didn't suit them."
-   "Viper-1, Phantoms are glitched units. Half in our dimension, half somewhere else. Both halves want you dead."
-   "HQ here. Orbiters were escort drones. They still escort. Just... aggressively. Very aggressively."
-   "Command to Viper-1. Splitters were self-replicating repair bots. The replication works. The repair part... not so much."
-   "Viper-1, the Sentinel Core was a defense grid controller. It's still defending. Against everything. Including us."
-   "HQ here. The Swarm Core was a drone carrier. It still carries drones. Angry, murderous drones."
-   "Command to Viper-1. The Obelisk is ancient. Pre-human ancient. It's been killing things longer than we've existed."
-   "Viper-1, this whole sector is a graveyard of a civilization we never met. Their security systems outlived them. Irony."
-   "HQ here. Whatever happened here, it happened fast. The machines are all that's left. And they remember."
-   "Command to Viper-1. You're flying through history. Violent, hostile history that wants to add you to the collection."
